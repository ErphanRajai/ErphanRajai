### Featured Systems

####  AI Radiologist Assistant (NIH Chest X-Ray 14)
* Engineered a multi-label classification system for 14 pathological conditions using **EfficientNet-B0**, achieving a mean AUC-ROC of 0.825.
* Developed a **Custom Native PyTorch CAM** implementation using forward and backward hooks to provide clinical interpretability, bypassing dependency conflicts inherent in standard 3rd-party libraries.
* Integrated **CLAHE** contrast enhancement for medical image normalization and resolved ASGI/Uvicorn event loop conflicts for stable cloud deployment.

####  FoodVision Big (Vision Transformer)
* [cite_start]Implemented a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** using PyTorch for 101-class image classification[cite: 53, 54, 55].
* [cite_start]Optimized the model using advanced data augmentation and transfer learning on a dataset of 100k+ images to ensure high generalization[cite: 56].
* [cite_start]Achieved 95% training accuracy and 90% test accuracy, deployed via a scalable web interface[cite: 56, 57].

####  Grammar Correction T5
* [cite_start]Fine-tuned a **T5-Small Transformer** on a 500MB Lang8 dataset for end-to-end linguistic error correction[cite: 58, 59].
* [cite_start]Achieved a 67.42 SacreBLEU score and a 0.857 ROUGE-1 score, demonstrating high accuracy in sequence-to-sequence generation[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]Publicly hosted with interactive Gradio and Streamlit interfaces for real-time inference[cite: 61].
