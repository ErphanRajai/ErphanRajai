### Featured Systems

#### AI Radiologist Assistant (NIH Chest X-Ray 14)
* Engineered a multi-label classification system for 14 pathological conditions using **EfficientNet-B0**, achieving a mean AUC-ROC of 0.825.
* Developed a **Custom Native PyTorch CAM** implementation using forward and backward hooks to provide clinical interpretability, bypassing dependency conflicts inherent in standard 3rd-party libraries.
* Integrated **CLAHE** contrast enhancement for medical image normalization and resolved ASGI/Uvicorn event loop conflicts for stable cloud deployment.

#### FoodVision Big (Vision Transformer)
* Implemented a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** using PyTorch for 101-class image classification.
* Optimized the model using advanced data augmentation and transfer learning on a dataset of 100k+ images to ensure high generalization.
* Achieved 95% training accuracy and 90% test accuracy, deployed via a scalable web interface.

#### Grammar Correction T5
* Fine-tuned a **T5-Small Transformer** on a 500MB Lang8 dataset for end-to-end linguistic error correction.
* Achieved a 67.42 SacreBLEU score and a 0.857 ROUGE-1 score, demonstrating high accuracy in sequence-to-sequence generation.
* Publicly hosted with interactive Gradio and Streamlit interfaces for real-time inference.
